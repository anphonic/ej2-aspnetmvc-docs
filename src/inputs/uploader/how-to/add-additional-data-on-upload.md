# Add additional data on upload

The uploader control allows you to add additional data on file upload, which is used to get in the server-side.
By using [uploading](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Uploading) event and its customFormData argument, you can achieve this behavior. Refer to the following example.

{% aspTab template="uploader/additional-data", sourceFiles="additional-data.css,index.css" %}

{% endaspTab %}
