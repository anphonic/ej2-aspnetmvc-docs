This can be achieved by using the [selected](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Selected) event. Refer to the following example to calculate the total file size.

{% aspTab template="uploader/file-size", sourceFiles="file-size.cs, index.css" %}

{% endaspTab %}
