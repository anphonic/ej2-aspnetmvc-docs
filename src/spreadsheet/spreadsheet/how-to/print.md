You can use the `print` method by importing from ej2-base package. Here, the `Select` event in the dropdown and the `dataBound` event are used to print the single/multiple sheets of data. To print the single/multiple sheets, use the dropdown button and select the `Print` (or) `Print All` option. In the following sample, you can be able to print the single/multiple sheets.
