## Spell check settings

### Remove Underline

By default, mis-spelled words are marked with squiggly line. You can also disable this behavior by enabling the `removeUnderline` API and now, the squiggly lines will never be rendered for mis-spelled words.

```typescript
this.container.documentEditor.spellChecker.removeUnderline = false;
```

### AllowSpellCheckAndSuggestion

By default, on performing spell check in Document Editor, both spelling and suggestions of the mis-spelled words will be retrieved, and this mis-spelled words can be corrected through context menu suggestions. You can modify this behavior using the `allowSpellCheckAndSuggestion` API, which will perform only spell check.

```typescript
this.container.documentEditor.spellChecker.allowSpellCheckAndSuggestion = false;
```

### LanguageID

Document Editor provides multi-language spell check support. You can add as many languages (dictionaries) in the server-side and to use that language for spell checking in Document Editor, it must be matched with `languageID` you pass in the Document Editor.

```typescript
this.container.documentEditor.spellChecker.languageID = 1033; //LCID of "en-us";
```
