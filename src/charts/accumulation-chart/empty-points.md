# Empty Points

The data points those uses the `null` or `undefined` as value are considered as empty points. The empty data points
are ignored and not plotted in the chart. You can customize those points, using the `EmptyPointSettings` property in
series. The default mode of the empty point is `Gap`. Other supported modes are `Average` and `Zero`.

{% aspTab template="chart/accumulation-charts/empty-points/empty", sourceFiles="empty.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Customization

Specific color for an empty point can be set by using the `Fill` property in `EmptyPointSettings` and the
border for an empty point can be set by using the `Border` property.
