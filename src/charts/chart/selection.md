# Selection

Chart provides selection support for the series and its data points on mouse click.

>When Mouse is clicked on the data points, the corresponding series legend will also be selected.

We have different type of selection mode for selecting the data. They are,

* None
* Point
* Series
* Cluster
* DragXY
* DragX
* DragY

## Point

 You can select a point, by setting `SelectionMode` to point.

{% aspTab template="chart/user-interaction/selection/point-selection", sourceFiles="point-selection.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Series

 You can select a series, by setting `SelectionMode` to series.

{% aspTab template="chart/user-interaction/selection/series-selection", sourceFiles="series-selection.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Cluster

You can select the points that corresponds to the same index in all the series, by setting `SelectionMode` to
cluster.

{% aspTab template="chart/user-interaction/selection/cluster-selection", sourceFiles="cluster-selection.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Rectangular selection

**DragXY, DragX and DragY**

To fetch the collection of data under a particular region, you have to set `SelectionMode` as `DragXY`.

* DragXY - Allows us to select data with respect to horizontal and vertical axis.
* DragX - Allows us to select data with respect to horizontal axis.
* DragY - Allows us to select data with respect to vertical axis.

The selected dataâ€™s are returned as an array collection in the [`DragComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Charts.Chart.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Charts_Chart_DragComplete)
event.
