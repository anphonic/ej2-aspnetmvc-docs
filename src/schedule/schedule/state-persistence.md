# Set state persistence

State persistence allowed Scheduler to retain the [`CurrentView`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Schedule.Schedule.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Schedule_Schedule_CurrentView), [`SelectedDate`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Schedule.Schedule.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Schedule_Schedule_SelectedDate) and Scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. This action is handled through the [EnablePersistence](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Schedule.Schedule.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Schedule_Schedule_EnablePersistence) property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, `CurrentView`, `SelectedDate` and Scroll position values of the scheduler component will be retained even after refreshing the page.

> **Note**: Scheduler `id` is essential to set state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% aspTab template="schedule/persistence", sourceFiles="data.cs"  %}
