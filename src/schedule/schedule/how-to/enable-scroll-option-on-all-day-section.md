# Enable scroll option on all-day section

When you have larger number of appointments in all-day row, it is difficult to view all the appointments properly. In that case you can enable scroller option for all-day row by setting true to `EnableAllDayScroll` whereas its default value is false. When setting this property to true, individual scroller for all-day row is enabled when it reaches its maximum height on expanding.

> Note: This property is not applicable for Scheduler with Height `auto`.
